Компоненти програмної інженерії 2: Перше практичне завдання на другий семестр

Dear credit module listener,

In order to pass the module you need to prepare and defend the following individual task:

* using Github create a project holding application in your favorite programming language.
The application finds approximate value of a function using Taylor series. The function is:

Variant 1: e^x
Variant 2: sin(x)
Variant 3: cos(x)
Variant 4: ln(1+x)
Variant 5: (1+x)^m
Variant 6: arctg(x)
Variant 7: 1/(1-x)
Variant 8: 1/(1+x)
Variant 9: sh(x)
Variant 10: ch(x)
Variant 11: sqrt(1-x)
Variant 12: ln((1+x)/(1-x))
Variant 13: 1/(1-x)^2
Variant 14: arcsin(x)
Variant 15: tg(x)

* Create a branch named Main holding implementation of the equation having the number of Taylor series members hardcoded to 4. Application version has to be set to 1.0.0.

* Fork new branch from main creating an application version 1.0.1
In this branch change the implementation making the number of Taylor series members to be definable through API.

* Fork branch 1.0.1 making version 1.0.2
In this branch implement unit test for your function.

* Switch to branch Main:
rename the function returning Taylor series adding letter A to its name

* Integrate branch 1.0.2 to Main solving a conflict in favor of the new name.

* Set version of the application in Main branch to 1.1.0

* Demo how you launch the Unit test
